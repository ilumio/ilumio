- 👋 Hi, I’m @ilumio
- 👀 The only reason I get led here is because I simply download the occasional app created on Github, but when I have issues I have no idea what to do when I get here.
- 🌱 I have no idea about coding and whenever I try to navigate this website I'm utterly baffled and find myself completely out of my depth.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... homostellaris@icloud.com
